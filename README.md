This is a Greamonkey/Tampermonkey Script that allows a user to map out the required Access Policies within the Cisco APIC GUI for ACI.

To use this, install AccPolMap.js like any other Grease/Tampermonkey Script.

You will see a new button when you navigate to Fabric > Access Policies.

At this point, you may need to refresh on that page to get the map button to appear. Once it appears, you can click it to open up a map of the objects required for a minimum working Access policy setup.

As you highlight certain objects within ACcess policies, you will see an arrow on the map that will indicate which piece of the Access Policies you are currently completing, and how they relate to the other policies.
